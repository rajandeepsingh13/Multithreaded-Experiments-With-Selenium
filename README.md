# Multithreaded Experiments With Selenium

this repository contains my experiments with multithreading in Selenium. It consists of 3 projects which were made using Selenium, TestNG and Java:

1. TestNG based Multithreading : Runs parallel tests and parallel classes at the same time.
2. TestNG based Multithreading : Running instances in parallel for each data set (read from an Excel file using Apache POI).
3. Java based Multithreading : To recursively check for broken links on a website while creating a new thread for each sub directory of the website.

Make sure Java, Eclipse, Selenium and TestNG are installed.
